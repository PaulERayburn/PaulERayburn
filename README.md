  # Brief Overview and Background
  
Given the specialized nature of the proposed software, we recognize that the user base may be limited. Therefore, building a community-oriented approach to ongoing development is essential. We've invested considerable resources to reach this stage and hope to foster reciprocal and continued investment from the community.

The intention is to support real estate appraisers in maintaining their role as independent, impartial experts in valuation.

The principles of this software are rooted in the teachings of George Dell https://georgedell.com/ or https://www.valuemetrics.info/ and the shared knowledge of the Community of Asset Analysts. https://georgedell.com/category/community-of-asset-analysts/

The assembly of code and packages into an initial conceptual platform provides numerous tools for users to explore their data and tie into a variety of resources to enhance the user's analysis.

I anticipate releasing this under some version of an open-source copyleft or open-core https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model; however, the funding model to support ongoing development has yet to be resolved. I would be happy to hear any feedback on the concept.
If you would like to see a bit of the Shiny dashboard in operation, I have created a short intro video https://youtu.be/XoaTngQFdF8?si=ty-mLD7_rO7kRQB7 We have implemented numerous additional features since that time.

#More about Paul Rayburn
I am a certified DAR and Certified Appraisal Reviewer based in the Okanagan Shuswap area of British Columbia, Canada, with over a decade of experience in the real estate valuation industry.

With a background in the production of world-class motor yachts, a field where I honed my appreciation for naval architecture, marine engineering, advanced composites, and project management, I transitioned into real estate appraisal after the 2008 financial crisis reshaped the local boat-building industry, combining my technical expertise with a passion for innovation in advanced valuation methodologies.

My work integrates trusted legacy methodologies with advances in data analytics and emerging technologies, aiming to make appraisal workflows more efficient and evidence-based.

I am deeply committed to advancing the appraisal profession and invite others in the field to explore Evidence-Based Valuation, a framework championed by George Dell (www.georgedell.com). This approach emphasizes leveraging data and analytics to enhance the reliability of valuation conclusions, bridging the gap between traditional methods and modern tools.

Though not a programmer, I am passionate about collaborating with others to develop and share tools that promote transparency and innovation in the appraisal process. Please reach out and connect if you would like to learn more.
