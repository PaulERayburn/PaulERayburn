  # Brief Overview and Background
  
Given the specialized nature of the proposed software, we recognize that the user base may be limited. Therefore, building a community-oriented approach to ongoing development is essential. We've invested considerable resources to reach this stage and hope to foster reciprocal and continued investment from the community.

The intention is to support real estate appraisers in maintaining their role as independent, impartial experts in valuation.

The principles of this software are rooted in the teachings of George Dell https://georgedell.com/ or https://www.valuemetrics.info/ and the shared knowledge of the Community of Asset Analysts. https://georgedell.com/category/community-of-asset-analysts/

The assembly of code and packages into an initial conceptual platform provides numerous tools for users to explore their data and tie into a variety of resources to enhance the user's analysis.

I anticipate releasing this under some version of an open-source copyleft or open-core https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model; however, the funding model to support ongoing development has yet to be resolved. I would be happy to hear any feedback on the concept.
If you would like to see a bit of the Shiny dashboard in operation, I have created a short intro video https://youtu.be/XoaTngQFdF8?si=ty-mLD7_rO7kRQB7 We have implemented numerous additional features since that time.
